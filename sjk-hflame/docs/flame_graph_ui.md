Interactive Flame Graph overview
=========

Flame graph could be generated with sjk using `sjk flame -f FILE -o report.html` command.

Result would be a self contained html file.

Visuals are generated dynamically using JavaScript so you may see placeholder screen 
for few seconds after opening a file.

Once visuals are generated, you should see a flame graph in all its colors. 
Graph would scale to width of your browser automatically, but vertical axis may require scrolling.

While hovering mouse over nodes in the graph you would see a tooltip with description on node.

Threads could be selected/deselected individually or by bulk operations (links right to search box).

 - `all` selects all visible threads
 - `only` selects all visible and deselects all invisible
 - `none` deselects all visible

Flame chart is content is updating based on thread filter.

State filter works similar way. State filter popup also displays number of samples for each state matching active thread filter.
